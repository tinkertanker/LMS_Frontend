# Using Tinkerfolio as an Teacher

## Creating a Class and Viewing All Classrooms

As a Teacher, you should see this page when you first login.

<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1MZPXrKh.png"></kbd>

To create a classroom, you will have to click the `Create Class` button and enter a name for the classroom, then click the `Create` button. 

<blockquote style="background-color:#FEEFD0; color:#364253; border-color:#877039; padding: 2% 3%">
    üí°The classroom‚Äôs name has a maximum length of 200 characters.
</blockquote>

<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1G7wXSt2.png"></kbd>


If successful, the new classroom should show up on the screen. To illustrate how the classrooms are displayed, we have created additional classrooms.

For Tinkerfolio, there are two types of classrooms: **Active**, and **Archived**. Within each type, classrooms are displayed in alphabetical order. Archived classrooms are always displayed after all Active classrooms, making it easier to look for classrooms that are still active. There is also a search feature, which you can use to further filter classrooms by name. 

Each classroom can be uniquely identified by its code - **this is needed for your students to join your classroom.**

To access a classroom, click on it.

<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryuVDXrtn.png"></kbd>


## Classroom Management

Each time you create a new classroom and access it, you will see the following interface. At the top left of the screen, the name of the classroom is displayed - clicking on it will allow you to change the name of the classroom.

<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1SBDXrF3.png"></kbd>


To easily obtain the access code, you can click on the `Join Info for Students` button. To easily copy the code, you can click on the clipboard icon. If successfully copied, the clipboard will be replaced with a green tick.

<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyTBvmrF3.png"></kbd>


The Settings button provides two features - to toggle the state of the classroom (Active/Archived), and to delete the classroom. 


## Tasks, Announcements and Resources

The classroom has three main aspects: Tasks, Announcements and Resources. Announcements and Resources can be accessed from the Announcements button.

### Tasks

#### Creating Tasks
    
To create a new task, you can click the red Task button. Here, you can either create a new task, or import tasks from other classrooms. 

<blockquote style="background-color:#FEEFD0; color:#364253; border-color:#877039; padding: 2% 3%">
    üí°Each task <b>must</b> have a name, but does not need to have a description.
</blockquote>

##### Types of Tasks
A task can either be saved as a Draft, or immediately Published for all students to see. 

A task could either be a group submission or individual submission. Selecting one of the options would be required. 
    
<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1pYjwv5n.png"></kbd>

##### Import Tasks

Should you wish to import tasks, you can click on the `Import Tasks` button. In this example, there are 4 total tasks in the ‚ÄúActive Class‚Äù classroom, with Task 2 saved as a draft, and all others are published. 
    
<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkctvmSth.png"></kbd>


As seen by the image above, only published tasks can be imported to other classrooms. When importing tasks, any number of tasks can be selected, and can be either saved as a Draft, or Published for students to see. 
    

#### Viewing and Managing Tasks
    
For this example, we have created and published some tasks, as shown from the image below.
    
<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ3nvmHt2.png"></kbd>

    
You can toggle the visibility of different classrooms, and to sort students (by index or number of stars), or tasks. In addition, you can view saved drafts and choose to edit or publish them. 
    
Published tasks will be visible in the main section of the page. By hovering over the chart icon, you can see the number of students who have completed the tasks, as well as the number of ungraded submissions. 
    
<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1savXBt3.png"></kbd>

    
By clicking the kebab menu, you can choose to edit tasks, hide it from view, or delete it completely.
    
<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkcADmSY2.png"></kbd>

#### Grading Submissions
    
For each task, students can **submit text and/or an image**. Additionally, they can show their progress, as shown by the image below:
    
<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1ukOQHKh.png"></kbd>

    
When students submit tasks, you will be able to see their submissions, similar to the image below.
    
<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkbgdQrKn.png"></kbd>

    
In the Student column, you can see the name of the student, and a graphical representation of their progress for each task. Grey means that a student has not clicked on the task, Yellow shows that a student has clicked into the task but has not completed, and Green shows that a task has been completed. 
    
To review a task, click on it. You will be presented with the following interface:
    
<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkeWOXSY2.png"></kbd>

    
If an image is submitted, it will also be displayed. You can choose to rate the student‚Äôs task, with a maximum of 5 stars, and provide any comments. When complete, click on the Submit button. After doing so, you should notice a few changes.
    
<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk2W_QSY3.png"></kbd>

    
The review can **no longer be edited**, and the student can **no longer resubmit work**. Additionally, the corresponding icon under the Student column will be a darker shade of green.
    
>:warning: The group submission for the same team would be identical (text uploaded by the group representative would be the same for all students in the team), however the teacher would still be required to grade them individually. This is to take account the case of possible difference in contribution of team members, and more personalised feedback. 

### Announcements

To add a new announcement, click on the Add Announcement button, enter the relevant information and click Done.

<blockquote style="background-color:#FEEFD0; color:#364253; border-color:#877039; padding: 2% 3%">
    üí° Each announcement <b>must</b> have a Title, but does not need a Body.
</blockquote>


<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hyc2OXHKh.png"></kbd>


If successful, you will see the new announcement, with the option to either edit or delete the announcement. If there are multiple announcements, it will be displayed in reverse chronological order.

<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJ56_XBFn.png"></kbd>


### Resources

To add a resource, click on the `Add Resource` button, enter the relevant information and click `Done`. There are no restrictions on what type of file can be uploaded here, unlike for student‚Äôs submissions.

<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk7CdQrF2.png"></kbd>


If successful, you will see a new Resource, with the ability to edit or delete the resource. Additionally, by clicking on the file name, you will be directed to a link to view the file.

<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ41BNHKh.png"></kbd>

To access the class, click on it. You should see something similar after accessing the classroom:

<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HytaBEBKh.png"></kbd>

At the top, you can see the name of the classroom, in this case "Example Class", the number of stars you have, and your position in class, based on the number of stars. 

In addition, you can click on the icon on the bottom left to view your details, including your name and the current class, as well as the option to log out. 

<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkvgZHHt2.png"></kbd>


The classroom consists of 3 main components: 

- Announcements
- Resources
- Tasks

### Announcements and Resources

Announcements and Resources can be accessed in two ways: by the logos on the left side, or the sections on the right, via either "View all Announcements" or "View all Resources".

Resources can contain files, while Announcements can contain only text. By clicking on the individual Announcement or Resource, you can view details of the announcement, or view the attached file. 

### Tasks

The main feature of Tinkerfolio is the ability to submit tasks and get feedback from your teacher. 

<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByQSmBHK2.png"></kbd>

As seen from the above image, all tasks are split into two types: complete and incomplete. To make the UI easier to navigate, completed tasks are moved to the bottom and highlighted in green. Within each type of tasks, the tasks are listed in chronological order. Additionally, tasks can be filtered by any combination of the following:

- Incomplete
- Completed & Ungraded
- Completed & Graded

Note the difference between a graded and ungraded task: Graded tasks **cannot** be resubmitted, but Ungraded tasks can be resubmitted. 


#### Submitting Tasks

##### Individual Task

To submit a task, click on the task. You should be able to see something similar. 

<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy3BOHSFn.png"></kbd>

If you have not completed the task, you can indicate your progress with the three icons at the top. This allows your teacher to know if they should check up on you and help you with the task in any way. 

Otherwise, you can submit the task, by providing either a text or file submission. Once complete, press `Submit`, and you will see your submission.

<blockquote style="background-color:#FEEFD0; color:#364253; border-color:#877039; padding: 2% 3%">
    üí° For file submissions, you <b>can</b> only upload image files with the following file extensions: <em>.jpg</em>, <em>.png</em>, and <em>.jpeg</em>.
</blockquote>

If you want to edit your submission, you can click on the green `Edit Submission` button. 

<kbd><img src="https://github.com/tinkertanker/LMS_Frontend/assets/88123171/da6c94bb-d031-42eb-bd68-1c8d66297d8f"></kbd>

The same interface will appear, allowing you to enter the new submission details. If you had previously submitted an image and now submit a text, the text will be added to the submission, and the image will still remain. The same will happen if you had already submitted text and decide to add an image. Changing the pre-existing text or image will replace the current text or image. 

##### Group Task
Students would be required to select their group members before submitting their task. The submission only takes in text and link, and  is **non-editable**. 

>:warning: If you happen to reload the page while selecting team members, the selection would not be saved and it would be resetted. Hence, exercise caution. 

<kbd><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJeipDPch.png"></kbd>

#### Reviewing Tasks

Teachers can review your tasks and grade it and provide feedback.
